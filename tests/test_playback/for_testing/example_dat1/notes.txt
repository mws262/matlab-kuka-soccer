joint_angles have timings on the rows, different joints on the columns, going from 1->7.
joint_angles have rows matching joint_timings. All ball data matches the rows in ball_timings.
contact_pt_timings cover the same time range as ball timings, but with gaps, since the contact point is intermittent.
Unless otherwise noted, ball radius is 0.1m.
